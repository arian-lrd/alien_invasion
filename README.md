# alien_invasion
A game inspired by "River Raid" from "Atari 2600"

## Background
alien_invasion was my first proper programing project. <br />
Python was the first programming language I started experimenting with. <br />
After 1 month of consuming pyhton knwoledge I decided to do something more ambitiouss than some easy practices. <br />
So I took one of the practices that interested me the most, alien-invasion skeleton practice from "Python crash course", worked on it for 100 hours and turned into the final version that I'm posting here. <br />

## Intro
This game is inspired by "River Raid" which I used to play as a kid with an old "Atari 2600". <br />
The player has should try to eliminate as many enemy ship fleets as possible. <br />
As the player proceeds through the levels the game will speed up and give more points per kill. The player's ship, as well as enemy fleet and their bullets will all speed up by a factor of "1.5" after each wave. <br />
Player has 3 lives to clear as many enemy waves as possible, and at the end their score will be comppared to the highest score, replacing it if the player has scored more points. <br />

## Structure
The skeleton code for the game is based on one of practices in the book *"python crash course: a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming"*.
But the practice was very simple and lacked all of the functionalities that make the game interesting. <br />
A quarteer of my time was spent on refining the games's existing functionalities. The rest of it was spent on adding features and debugging. 


I added all of the following features to the game:
1. Main menu - A dedicated screen for the main menu with instructions and a background theme song 
2. Background music - A theme song for the game's menu & A playlist of randomly playing songs for when the game is playing.
3. Space background - A background of space and stars to give the game a more immersive feel
4. Enemies shooting back - With this add-on the enemy ships shoot back the player when the player shoots at them
5. Explosion sounds - Explosion sounds that play when an enemy ship or the player's ship is destroyed
6. Game Over sound - A sound that plays when the player is out of lives.
7. New ship designs - I replaced the player's ship and uniquely redesigned enemy ships to look  more *"cool"*
